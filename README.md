# 🌐 My First Website 

#### 🔰overview

- It all started with this – my very first web page. While the design might be far from perfect and the layout a bit rough around the edges, this simple and "ugly" page marks the beginning of my journey into web development. It's where I first experimented with HTML and CSS, and it holds a special place as the foundation of everything I’ve built since. Every line of code here represents curiosity, learning, and the start of something greater.
